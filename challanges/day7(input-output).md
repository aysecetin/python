# Output 🤓

- We have already seen how to output something but let's recap.

⇨ In programming it's often called "printing" to output something.

⇨ In Python to print something to the screen we use print()

***For example,***
```py
print("Hello")
```
The above example prints "Hello" to screen.

⇨ Recall that you must enclose what you want to print with "" or with '', it is a string inside the print().
