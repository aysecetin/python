# Hello World! 🙋🏻‍♀️🌏

- The "Hello World!" is a simple program that outputs Hello World! to the screen.

- In Python, we use print() to show words on the screen. The words go inside quotation marks.

- Let's take a look at the "Hello World!" program in Python:

```py
print("Hello World!")
```


## Challenge (Beginner) 🤔🤔

- Use the code view to write a program that outputs Hello World!

**Note** that anything inside quotation marks is case sensitive. For example:

```py
print("Hello World!")
print("hello world!")
```
are different things (notice the capital letters in the first line).

## Solution 🤗🤗

```py
print("Hello World!")
```
