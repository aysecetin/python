# DAY 4 

## Boolean

- A bool (Boolean) type has only 2 possible values: True or False.

- To assign a bool value to a variable,

```py
variable_true = True
variable_false = False
```
- In the above example, two variables named variable_true and variable_false are initialized, with the values True and False respectively.

**Note**   
- Booleans are the building blocks for creating logic in the programs we write. We have a whole chapter about logic and conditions.



## Challenge

Declare a variable named boolean and assign it the value True.

## Solution

```py
# Type your code below
boolean = True

# Don't change the line below
print(f'boolean = {boolean}')
```


## Challenge


- Write code that initializes the following variables:

⇨ k with the value 88    
⇨ PI with the value 3.14     
⇨ name with the value "bob"     

**Note**  
*Make sure you use the exact variables names and values. Remember, Python is case sensitive!*

## Solution

```py
# Type your code below
k = 88
PI = 3.14
name = "bob"

# Don't change the line below
print(f"k = {k}")
print(f"PI = {PI}")
print(f"name = {name}")
```
