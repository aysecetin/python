# Declare a Function

- A function is a sequence of code that has a name. The purpose of a function is to reuse a piece of code multiple times.

**For example,** take a look at this code:

```py
print("Welcome to Coddy")
print("New session...")
print("Welcome to Coddy")
print("Another session...")
print("Welcome to Coddy")
```

- We use the same code print("Welcome to Coddy") over and over again. Another issue with this code is that if we wanted to change the message: Welcome to Coddy to something different, like "Welcome aboard" it would have to change 3 different lines of code. To solve this issue, we will use functions.

- To declare a function, we use the following syntax:

```py
def function_name():
    code
For our example, we will create a function named greet and it will look like this:

def greet():
    print("Welcome to Coddy")
```


- To use/call/execute the function, we write greet():
```py

greet()
print("New session...")
greet()
print("Another session...")
greet()
```
- This will result in the same output as above.

Important! The function code must come before it's call/execution
