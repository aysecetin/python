# *Input* 👩🏻‍💻

⇨ As of now we stored values that we thought about in variables. Programs usually don't work this way. We receive values from an outer source, a user for example.

⇨ To get input from a user or the system we need to write:
```py
var = input()
```
This will store the input in the variable var.

⇨ The input is always of type string. For example, if the input is 56 then var will hold the string "56".
